### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bryce

I'm a software engineer and reformed chemist who works on cool things at GitHub.

I've previously worked in fintech as a software engineer and infosec consulting. I started my tech career after deciding that chemistry wasn't the right career for me in the middle of my PhD (my adviser leaving also played a part in the decision).

I'm interested in fullstack app development, cloud computing, infosec, and have been learning ðŸ¦€ slowly in my free time.
